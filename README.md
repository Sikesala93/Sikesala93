### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sirkku. This year I graduated from Lappland's University of Applied Sciences. I now have a bachelor's degree in ICT engineering. I have experience in Software technologies and specialise in Web and mobile development (full-stack). I really enjoy learning languages and Frameworks. I also have an interest in UI, UX and design in general. You can check out my LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/sirkku-kes%C3%A4lahti-605109197/.
